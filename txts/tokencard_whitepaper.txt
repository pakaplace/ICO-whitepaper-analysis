TOKENCARD EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

TokenCard Executive Summary
The Debit Card

TokenCard is a debit card usable at payment terminals around the world, including ATMs. TokenCard
customers back/fund their own card with allowances from ERC20 compatible contract wallets. At
launch, TokenCard will allow users to fund their card with ETH, TKN and up to five of the following
tokens that will be elected for inclusion by the community: REP, MKR, DGD, ICN, MLN, GNT, 1ST
and SNGLS.

1.2

The TKN Token

TokenCard is creating the TKN tokens for a limited time. A fixed number will be created during the
presale, and no more will be created thereafter. The TKN Token provides a TKN holder with the
right to use the TokenCard for transaction using TKN without having to pay additional licensing
fees (transaction fees charged by third party card issuers and payment system providers remain
applicable). Payments made with TokenCard using tokens other than TKN is, however- in addition to
the transaction fee charged by the card issuing partner – subject to the payment of a license fee as
remuneration for the use of the software protocol developed as part of the TokenCard project. The
TKN Asset Contract, accrues this 1% licensing fee on debit card transactions using tokens other than
TKN. TKN holders can burn their TKN in return for a pro-rata share of accumulated licensing fees
through a unique mechanism licensed from New Alchemy called “Cash and Burn”. Fees from card
swipes will be assessed in the token being used to fund the swipe. These fees will be sent directly to
the TKN Asset Contract. Over time, this contract will - in a fully automated way and without any
management required- accrue tokens in proportion to the tokens used by TokenCard customers around
the world. For a full description of the TKN token, see section 7.

1.3

Cash and Burn

At any time, a holder of TKN can “Cash and Burn” the TKN. Thereby, a holder of TKN burns and in
return receives a pro-rata share of licensing fees held by the TKN Asset Contract. The holder will
irrevocably destroy the TKN, and in exchange, the TKN Asset Contract will transfer the respective
tokens to the holder.

1.4

TKN Creation Event

TokenCard aims to create $4.5mm of TKN for sale in exchange for ETH and other tokens from our
initial token partners. We believe so strongly in the future of the token economy that not only are we
the first company to offer to create our tokens in exchange for other tokens, we will give contributions
in certain tokens a discount.
For full details on the TKN Creation Event, see section 9.2. In brief, the tokens will be sold at a
discount to early buyers at a rate sliding from 150 TKN : 1 ETH down to 100 TKN: 1 ETH at the
$4.5mm mark. If the cap is reached, we will continue to sell and create TKN for 24 hours – this will
protect those who wish to participate in the event if all tokens sell out quickly.
Those who purchase with other tokens from our approved list will receive a 2.5% - 5% TKN bonus,
depending on the token.
If funds are raised to the cap and ETH is priced at $50, about 21 million tokens will be created.

Use of Funds

MOTIVATION

Use of Funds

The proceeds from the funds will finance development, partnership programs, float (both fiat and
token), operations, regulatory and most importantly, marketing and customer acquisition.
Most of these costs are somewhat fixed. For more details read our Use of Funds section 9.7.
Because of this, any money we receive from pre-sales over our minimum will largely go to marketing
and customer acquisition. This creates a value multiplier for the project: as we have more money we
will be able to spend a higher percentage on customer acquisition and boost spending commensurately.
We believe issuing TokenCard in China will be critical to building the transactional volume for the
card. Entering the Chinese market from the outside can be difficult and expensive; the more successful
our TKN creation event, the more quickly we will be able to capture this market.

1.6

Prudence: Reserve Tokens

We have some concerns about other project’s capitalization in these early days of the token economy.
In particular, most projects dilute out their token holdings by 80%; this dilution isn’t equity dilution,
but worse – often giving away 80% of gross revenues. This may be imprudent.
Lessons from modern markets show that both debt and equity are useful tools for raising capital.
Therefore we are minting an amomunt of 15% of all TKN but not offering them for sale during this
presale.
These TKN will not be issued or sold during the initial pre-sale and are locked in a smart contract. If
at some point it seems advisable for the TokenCard project to sell more tokens, some or all of these
may be offered in an auction format or some other format that suits the capital needs of the project.
In the interim, these TKN will not be used in any way. They will not be considered as issued for Cash
and Burn calculations. They will not grant anyone other usage benefits in the TokenCard system.
It is possible these TKN will never be issued, however, we feel it is prudent to have some backup if
needed. In any event, TokenCard will engage directly with TKN holders to seek guidance and market
reaction before any of the Reserve tokens are offered.

1.7

The Future

We have big plans. Our mobile app will allow customers a number of features that they cannot easily
access with other digital currency and token wallet apps. Read more in Section 4.1.
We aim over time to bring about a world which makes access to tokens far easier than it is today, far
more intuitive, with far less friction.

2

Motivation

7 years after the creation of Bitcoin, one of the greatest experiments to date, we have witnessed the
emergence of a new industry. Ethereum has added a Turing-complete layer into the mix, and broadened
the horizon of what is possible by an order of magnitude. This in turn has facilitated the creation of a
new synergistic ecosystem, one that promises to overturn the status-quo.

USER SCENARIOS

Over the years numerous attempts have been made to bring cryptocurrency to the masses yet adoption
is still slow and cumbersome. These companies and projects have failed to identify and address the
main issues present in making mass adoption of digital assets possible. The core issues remain:
1. Security, storing assets is cumbersome and inevitably people choose to store their assets
under a third party’s control, like an exchange. This defeats one of the greatest properties of
cryptocurrency, and exposes them to risks that have consistently proven to be catastrophic. A
system is needed that can securely store assets without compromise on usability.
2. Usability, numerous steps are often involved in seeing real use of one’s digital assets. A user
needs wallets, exchanges and accounts on various services. They are required to withdraw,
deposit, do KYC and even become amateur traders. A system is needed that eliminates
these steps, and offers a seamless plug-and-play experience for the uninitiated that
can be integrated across platforms.
3. Volatility, forcing people to use a volatile asset like Bitcoin is a no-go. The people have spoken,
and it deters more than it attracts leaving only a risk-taking fringe. A stable, more diverse
asset class is needed.
Through the game-changing power of Ethereum we now have the tools at hand to create a distributed
banking replacement for the post-bank era that promises to solve these problems and in the process
outperform traditional banking counterparts in flexibility, efficiency and transparency.
The Token and TokenCard platform proposed in this document strategically targets and solves these
issues and will position itself at the heart of the effort to facilitate the mainstream adoption of the
compelling Ethereum Ecosystem and dominate this next phase in financial history.

User Scenarios
Remittance to Mom

Mac lives in Florida, and his mother lives in the Philippines. Every month, Mac sends home money
for her. He used to use Western Union (expensive), tried Paypal (froze funds for no reason) and then
wired directly from his bank (slow and expensive).
Mac doesn’t have any interest in speculation, but he does want to be able to help his mom out and
make sure she stays safe and doesn’t have trouble because she has too much cash at one time. He also
wants to be able to get her money instantly when she needs it.
Every month he purchases enough money in a few different stable tokens, including DollarCoins and
Dai - kept in his own token Wallet. He went ahead and signed his mom up for a TokenCard. She uses
it at ATMs and merchants across the Philippines. If she’s running low, Mac transfers her more funds.
Because the transfers happen directly on the Ethereum Blockchain, he can get his mom money in less
than 15 seconds. And Mac feels happy because the fees are extraordinarily reasonable.
This problem goes away completely, and Mac doesn’t worry about his mom anymore.

TOKEN PLATFORM DETAILED OVERVIEW

Sonja is tired of moving money around between REP, 1ST and her bank account. Her bankers are
confused by where she gets her money. She decides to close her bank account altogether and get a
TokenCard.
She is starting to learn more about the decentralized economy and is glad she has a TokenCard; any
earnings are directly available to be used in the real world. No action required. She recently uploaded
a popular video to SingularDTV and can see her SNGLS balance grow steadily in the Token App. She
won’t look back.

3.3

Indonesian worker

Amir lives in Indonesia. He works hard and saves money for his family. In the past his savings have
lost a lot of their value as a concequence of national currency fluctuations. This doesn’t sit right with
him, so he has been looking for solutions. Disapointingly local banks only support Indonesian Rupiah
and other services are hard to apply for.
Amir was able to apply and do KYC directly from within the Token App in minutes. Astounded by
the possibilities, Amir has now decided to hold his savings in a comfortable mix of Gold, Dollar and
Euro tokens.
He has never heard about blockchain, bitcoin or ethereum. But the Token app gives him a curated
and comfortable enviroment for him to use this technology in. Amir is convinced he has made the
right choice.

3.4

San Francisco Transplant

James is a 23 year old Englishman living in San Francisco, and he has no bank account. He doesn’t
trust banks. Instead he uses TokenCard for most purchases. Every time he wants to buy something,
he pulls out his TokenCard, swipes his card, and the merchant is paid.
James is also really worried about the US currency and its ability to hold value, so he doesn’t like to
have dollars in his investment portfolio. Instead he has a combination of digital currencies – ETH and
DAI, and also precious metals like Digix Gold stored in his own contract wallet.
When James swipes his TokenCard, the TokenCard System sells a little bit of each of his Tokens,
keeping James’ asset allocation at his desired rates, and uses the proceeds to fund his purchase.
With TokenCard and the Ethereum Blockchain, James stays in control of his investments at all times –
the funds only leave his wallet when he swipes, and then only if the transaction meets pre-specified
requirements.

Token Platform Detailed Overview
Smart Contract Wallet

Upon a user joining the platform they launch their own Token Contract Wallet, or grant allowances to
their existing wallets.
This Contract Wallet acts as the equivalent of a bank account that holds funds and enforces security
parameters, but, crucially, it is controlled only by the user. Users run through a setup wizard and are
prompted to customize settings to fit their preference, including:

Token App

TOKEN PLATFORM DETAILED OVERVIEW

• Setting daily limits to safeguard assets
• Setting up a base currency for example ETH (any fiat deposited into this will automatically
convert upon load).
Typically digital currency security is a tradeoff between usability and functionality. Users must trade
security of their funds for convenience when they decide whether to hold tokens themselves or leave
them at an exchange. We think we can do better.
By shifting control of user assets back into their own hands and giving them easy to manage fine-grained
control of their digital assets safeguarded by the security of smart contracts, users can have better
security and substantially improved usability.

4.2

Token App

The Token App is the main way a user interacts with his Token Contract Wallet and TokenCard. The
Token app operates the Token Contract Wallet and gives customers a simple way to access their token
portfolio and manage their debit card and security profiles.
Our roadmap for the App includes the following (MVP/Alpha features in bold)
4.2.1

Spending Options

• Single (Single Asset spend)
• Multi Asset (Splits Transaction between multiple assets)
• Portfolio Spending (Maintains a desired portfolio allocation)

4.3

Fees

As we will be working with a payments network Partner, we also are subject to their fee schedule. Fees
are set by the partner and are revenue-shared with TokenCard. This is expected to be the main source
of operating revenue for the company. A full fee schedule is available in the end user agreement on
delivery of the card.
We also charge a 1% licensing fee that accrues to TKN holders. This fee is billed in the underlying
token being sold and is smart contract enforced, 100% of these fees will be sent to the TKN Asset
Contract. TKN holders have the possibility to burn TKN and in return collect a pro-rata share of the
TKN Asset Contract, i.e. to ‘cash and burn’ rather than merely hold TKN.
TKN tokens themselves are not subject to the licensing fee. TKN is described in greater detail in the
‘TKN’ section - 7.

Credit Card/Debit Card Purchase

TOKENCARD AT A GLANCE

Credit Card/Debit Card Purchase

Sending tokens directly to the Token Contract Wallet works for people who are already familiar with
Ethereum. However, as our objective is to allow non-Ethereum users to access the platform, we need
other solutions. The first is a simple debit card or credit card purchase of tokens through our app. For
certain assets with enough liquidity, we can provide a simple fiat to crypto exchange service. This is a
relatively simple financial service to offer, however it may require regulatory approval and adequate
fraud mitigation, and as such will be a feature not available in the MVP release, but most likely in a
later release instead.

4.5

Agent Network Deposits

The vision for Token is to enable users to cancel their bank account, and to provide a solution to
users without one. Loading your Token wallet using a credit/debit card is only sufficient for those who
already are served by some level of banking.
To reach a larger audience, we may integrate with agent networks such as Western Union and PayPoint,
which allow for cash or check deposits with their agents. These agent deposits would remit to
TokenCard, which would convert to tokens and allows us to credit the user’s Token Wallet, without
the need for a credit/debit card.

5
5.1

TokenCard at a glance
Control

TokenCard users are able to store and transfer tokenized assets securely, without introducing a third
party. By retaining control, users never subject themselves to centralized risks, whilst benefiting from
the efficiency and cost reduction that comes with eliminating a third party.

5.2

Community

The project will focus on initially providing a solution for the Ethereum community, with a smart
contract powered debit card that can spend Ether and other ERC20 compliant tokens and allows for
various spending modes that support the lifestyles of those who wish to transact primarily in tokens.

5.3

General Public

Moving forward, the project will shift focus to the general public. By using our debit card as an
introduction to this transformative technology, we aim to provide a familiar user interface (a plastic
card and app) where users retain all the benefits of Ethereum without having to master them.

5.4

Synergy

TokenCard directly benefits from the powerful products currently being developed on Ethereum like
asset-backed tokens, stable coins and other tokenized assets and strongly supplements their value
proposition. By providing a way for these projects to become useful to people outside of the community
through TokenCard, they can expand their market dramatically.

Standard Wallet

MARKET

TokenCard makes every token better

5.5

Standard Wallet

TokenCard is capable of working directly with the standard ERC20 contract wallets (Ethereum
Foundation/Consensys/Parity). These token wallets are relatively secure, but not as widely used as
hoped. We believe the improved usability and focus on real-world transactional security needs will
make the Token Contract Wallet a desirable first-class wallet solution for most token holders.

5.6

Gateway

TokenCard allows for mass adoption of consumer-facing Ethereum platforms like Singular and FirstBlood that greatly benefit from the streamlining of the user experience. With TokenCard integration
users can seamlessly start reaping the benefits of Ethereum dapps without needing to perform complicated actions.

5.7

Token Agnostic

The platform is token agnostic – users are given freedom to chose how to hold value and transact.
With TokenCard, regular users will have an expanding pool of assets at their fingertips within the
Token App.

5.8

Innovative spending options

Users will be able to pay in multiple assets at the same time while keeping their portfolio balanced.
This is a world first; customers will be able to keep all of their assets fully invested at all times, and
not worry about manual reallocation when they wish to spend.

6

Market

Our current roadmap focuses on several distinct markets and user-bases where TokenCard is best
positioned to excel. In general, we have the underlying Ethereum community, platform specific markets
and general public banking replacement.

6.1

Ethereum Community

Providing a payment solution for the underlying Ethereum community is the most basic use-case for
this market. However, it should not be underestimated. With a rapidly growing market cap among
Ether and ERC20 tokens, there is an accompanying need for payment utility of assets on the network.
The Market Cap for Ether alone currently sits close to $3,000,000,0001 dollars. We expect to spearhead
and capture the bulk of the payments market on Ethereum as TokenCard offers solutions to systematic
problems in the space and is native to Ethereum. We expect substantial transactional volume with
TokenCard and this will scale with the Ethereum/Token economy.

Platform Specific Markets

MARKET

Platform Specific Markets

The most exciting use-cases for TokenCard are within the many different markets that are being tapped
into by other projects in the space. We are actively integrating TokenCard with these native Ethereum
platforms, giving TKN holders direct access to diversified markets while providing connections to a
major payment rail for the platform’s underlying user-base.
We believe that this is where TokenCard’s true role in the ecosystem lies, with integration benefitting:
TokenCard, the integrated platform, and most importantly, the end users themselves. This also suggests
strong growth prospects for TKN; the success of integrated platforms translates directly across to
TKN holders.
TokenCard makes every partnered project with a token far, far better. We believe there will be rapid
uptake by token holders worldwide.

6.3

Ditching Banks Altogether

Sentiment and expectation towards what ‘banking’ is and what it should be, is rapidly changing. 94%
of consumers under 35 years old are active users of online banking, and another 27% would consider a
branchless digital bank. 33% of millennials believe they won’t need a bank in five years, and 33% are
also open to switching banks in the next 90 days. A final 71% would rather go to the dentist than
listen to what banks say.2 With a growing distrust and detachment between banks and consumers, it
is fair to say that there is a tech savvy market open to innovation.
TokenCard more than qualifies as a candidate for regular users looking to get rid of their bank
altogether, offering not only a top-tier UI/UX experience, but also providing genuine innovation
through Ethereum.
Low-cost immediate network transfer of assets, access to the token economy, complete control of ones
assets and exposure to an ecosystem of innovators will more than appeal to current and forthcoming
generations.

6.4

Chinese Market

We will be able to issue TokenCards into the Chinese market at launch. We believe this is a massive
opportunity. Tokens are popular in China already, and experience shows there will be rapid innovation
in the Chinese market – some will filter to the West quickly, and some may not. Either way, TKN
holders will get access to this innovation at the same time Chinese customers get the benefits of the
card.

6.5

Marketing/Product Strategy

6.5.1

Ethereum / Token Market

Our initial target market will be token holders of other projects and the Ethereum community in
general. This is not a numerically large group, but it is extraordinarily wealthy, and strongly demands
this product.

TKN IN DEPTH

Because TokenCard makes every other token project better, it will grow rapidly whenever any one of
the other token projects sees growth. We forecast massive growth in the token ecosystem over the next
two years, and will be there to provide real value to each token issuer.
We will be granting the top 500 pre-purchasers of TKN with a complementary special
edition TokenCard and access to the Beta/MVP.
6.5.2

Broader Market

Our strategy to capture the general public will start with social media, and likely extend to partnerships
and traditional media. We’ll be working closely with a dedicated marketing team to construct campaigns
and strategies to attract a broader user to the platform.
Strategies that tap into network effects, for example, by recommending friends and family to the
platform in exchange for a free card, will be key to growing the platform. TokenCard’s role within the
Ethereum ecosystem offers sufficient innovation to capture interest from larger media outlets, which
will complement our marketing effort.
We believe we will be able to capture significant ROI on Customer Lifetime Value vs. Acquisition cost
in many markets, and plan to spend a significant portion of the token sale proceeds on growing this
customer base, while remaining judicious and careful.

7

TKN In Depth

TKN is a special kind of Ethereum token. It is the base currency of the TokenCard and provides
advantageous usage rights and benefits to its holder with regard the TokenCard : Whereas transactions
in other tokens using the debit card pay a 1% smart contract enforced licensing fee, such licensing fee
does not apply to transactions in TKN. TKN holders can in addition burn their TKN an in return
collect a pro-rata share of licensing fees accumulated in the TKN Asset Contract through a unique
mechanism called “Cash and Burn”.

7.1

DGX Purchase Example

A TokenCard customer holds DGX (A gold-backed token) and prefers to conduct her affairs in gold.
She has dinner at her local bistro, and the cost totals $50. This $50 equates to roughly 1.2 DGX. She
swipes her TokenCard.
TokenCard’s servers immediately withdraw 1.2DGX plus the Licensing fee from her Token Contract
Wallet. The Licensing fee is 1%, so she pays in total 1.212DGX. 1.2DGX is exchanged by TokenCard
for USD. These USD will be swept into TokenCard’s debit card account as float for the next card
swipe.
The remaining 0.012DGX is sent directly to the TKN Asset Contract.
Since fees are paid in the token transacted in, the most popular tokens used for transacting will
accumulate respective licensing fees to the TKN Asset Contract.

TKN IN DEPTH

Cash and Burn

A TKN holder can burn his TKN and in return collect a current pro-rata share of licensing fees
accumulated in the TKN Asset Contract by calling TKN’s burn function. Doing so will permanently
destroy the TKN.
7.2.1

Definitions

There are TKNT TKN issued.
There are TKNh units of TKN held by a certain holder of TKN.
There are m distinct tokens held in the TKN Asset Contract.
The TKN Asset Contract holds Tm tokens for the mth token contract.
Then the holder of TKN, if he decides to trigger the “Cash and Burn” function and thereby relinquish
its TKN, will receive the following pro-rata share of licensing fees accumulated in the TKN Asset
Contract:
Received:
[T1 , T2 , . . . , Tm ] ∗

7.3

TKNh
TKNT

Cash and Burn Example 1

A TKN holder has 500TKN, the current TKN supply is 10000TKN.
The TKN Asset Contract holds 10DAI, 100ETH, 500DGX and 250REP.
His pro-rata share of licensing fees accumulated in the TKN Asset Contract equals:
[10DAI, 100ET H, 500DGX, 250REP ] ∗

500
10000

If he burns his TKN, he will receive
500
= 5.00%
10000
of the held tokens, giving him:
[0.5DAI, 5ET H, 25DGX, 12.5REP ]
After ‘burning’ his TKN, the remaining supply of TKN will now equal:
10000 − 500 = 9500
This means that remaining TKN holders, if they decide to trigger the ‘Cash and Burn’ function, will
recieve a higher pro-rata share of the licensing fees per TKN than before the burn. A separate TKN
holder who also held 500 TKN would now have a pro-rata share equal to:
500
= 5.26%

TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP

Cash and Burn Example 2

If the TKN supply is 1,000,000 and a certain user has 100 TKN, and the Asset Contract holds DGX,
DGD, REP and SNGLS in the following ratios, then the User’s pro-rata share of the licensing fees
would be as follows:
Token

Number Held

5.5
100.0

The user with 100 TKN wants to burn is TKN and collect his pro-rata share of the licensing fees
accumulated in the TKN Asset Contract. He burns the 100 TKN, and receives 1 DGX and 2 DGD,
5.5 REP and 100.0 SNGLS.
All the other TKN are still backed by 0.01 DGX, 0.02 DGD and etc. per TKN.

7.5

Economic Consequences of The TKN Model

The TokenCard platform will over time grow to support tokens from most, if not all projects. This is
likely to grow to a staggering number of unique tokens. If a specific token becomes valuable or popular
its proportional use with TokenCard will go up and as such will accrue to the Asset Contract.
Burning reduces the total pool of TKN in circulation and proporionally increases the stake of future
licensing fees to remaining TKN holders. We expect TKN burning to be rare, but to the extent it
occurs, TKN holders who do nothing will gain a proportional increase in the share of future fees.

7.6

TKN Fee Reduction

As the base currency of TokenCard, transactions using TKN pay no licensing fee for the TKN amount
of the fee. If a user transacts purely in TKN, he pays no licensing fee. If a transaction involves multiple
currencies the fee for the portion paid in TKN is voided.
7.6.1

Portfolio Spending Example

Let’s go back to our first example where a user is paying for a $50 meal at a restaurant. Let’s say now
she decides to pay for the meal half in DGX and the other half in TKN. Essentially this would be two
transactions: $25 each in DGX and TKN.
The licensing fee paid will only be on the $25 DGX transaction, and would equate to half of the
original fee of 0.012 DGX, in total 0.006DGX for the same transaction.

Contract Wallet

8.1

TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP

Contract Wallet

The Token Contract Wallet is a smart contract that governs a user’s tokens and secures them within
its code. The Token Contract Wallet’s main function is to host to the users digital assets in a secure
manner and allows for various functionality integrated directly into the system. It serves as the
foundation for the rest of the platform’s features.
Users will not need a contract wallet to try out the system, instead they can grant an allowance.
However, the Token Contract Wallet will allow fine-grained security features, and we anticipate users
will either migrate to the wallet, or “wrap” their preferred wallet with the Token Contract Wallet in
general.

8.2

Contract Wallet Access

Access to the systems can be achieved by:
1. The Token App – Provides a refined and user friendly experience with a setup wizard, and
simple ability to integrate with user’s existing Token wallet.
2. Blockchain Browser – Third party Ethereum browser tools like Mist, Parity and MetaMask
can give access to TokenCard systems. TokenCard smart contracts will be created with Web3
support in mind, and Web3 support will be considered for all frontend TokenCard applications.

8.3

Allowance

TokenCard has access to withdraw funds from the user’s Token Contract Wallet and is constrained
by these user set options. We plan an array of awesome features over time, and will start with basic
security features in the MVP.
Options are not mutually exclusive; more than one could be active at any time.
• Daily Fiat Limits - Uses an oracle to calculate fiat amount and sets a cap based on that. Will
initially use a TokenCard-maintained oracle until reliable third party options become available in
the community.
Example: $1000 equivalent in tokens can be spent per day.
• Daily Token Limits - A fixed number of tokens per day are allowed to be withdrawn.
Example: 20 ETH per day.
• Percentage Limits - A fixed percentage of Tokens per given time period allowed to be withdrawn.
Example: 2% of each spendable tokens per day are allowed to be withdrawn.
• Time based Limits - Opening up withdrawals for a specified amount of time.
Example: 1h long allow up to large $10k spends – this would be triggered by a button in the app marked
something like “GO BIG”.

8.4

Additional Security Features

There are a number of security scenarios we are workshopping now. Some will likely be supported in
the final app.

Card Spending Modes

8

TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP

1. User set limits A user could set daily contract withdrawal limits on their own side to prevent
losses in the event a third party gains access to their private key and password. Alternatively
the user could limit the specific addresses the contract could withdraw to.
This could be combined with an Emergency Contract Migration, as defined below, and would significantly mitigate the risk of catastrophic loss of tokens.
2. Emergency Contract Migration A user could preemptively allow TokenCard to send all
tokens to a pre-specified ‘safe’ destination in case of emergency. Could be called by either party
in case of an ongoing attack.
Example: A user with poor personal security has lost access to his Token Contract Wallet, but did
grant TokenCard the right to do an emergency sweep if something bad happens. Limits on his own side
prevent a third party attacker from withdrawing more than $100 per day.
One day the Token app gives him a push notificaiton of a $100 withdrawal he did not authorize. He
contacts TokenCard support to initiate an emergency contract migration to a predefined safe sweep
address that he controls. TokenCard remains functional throughout the process, and the user has
minimized losses.
3. Temporary Card freeze – Pauses card use in the case of misplacement. Can be re-enabled at
any time.

8.5

Card Spending Modes

With TokenCard we are able to pioneer a number of flexible and unique ways to manage spending.
The main spending modes planned are:
• Single asset spending - A single asset is selected to be made available to be spent with
TokenCard. Other assets can be added to the queue to give an order of priority.
Example: A $100 swipe is payed for in ETH.
• Multi asset spending – A user can pay with multiple assets at a time. He can select up to
5 different assets, giving each a percentage and distributing the payment between them. This
allows unprecedented control of personal portfolio allocation.
Example: A user has set up his TokenCard to pay with 50% ETH, 30% REP and 20% DGX. When
she pays for a $500 utility bill, the equivalent of $250 of ETH, $150 of REP and $100 of DGX are
withdrawn simultaneously from her Token Contract Wallet.
• Dynamic portfolio spending - Spending is based on fiat weighting of assets. Users give target
portfolio weightings and withdrawals are optimized to maintain the user given weightings.
Example: A user targets a portfolio value of 20% DGX and 80% ETH. Recently the value of DGX has
gone up and now represents a larger percentage of the portfolio. This means a card swipe will now
withdraw proportionally more DGX to bring the percentage closer to the set target.
• Other spending modes – tax efficient, illiquid proxy asset and other spending modes are being
explored to aid users in specific scenarios.

8.6

Multi-User management

Wallet holders may attach specific allowances or other rules to multiple cards. These could have
many features: from family budget management to expense account reimbursement rules. Watch-only
accounts may be set up to monitor expenses.

TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP

Token App (iOS/Android)

The Token App (Android & iOS) is the primary interface customers will use to interact with the
platform. The Token App is designed to give best-in-class functionality with a top-tier UI design.

8.8

Set-up Wizard

Upon first launch the users run through a setup wizard and are prompted to customize settings to fit
their preference. The process includes the following steps:
1. A user downloads the app
2. User can create new contract/key or import key.
3. Puts in password and is prompted to make a backup of key.
4. Contract launches/loads (TokenCard pays for gas)
5. Choose express or advanced setup wizard.
6. User chooses his base currency from a ranked/curated list
• Likely a list of ‘stable’ currencies and other assets, like DGX or DAI.
• The base token is what the Token Contract Wallet is loaded with if fiat is sent to fund the
wallet.
Example: A user sets his base currency as DGX. He sends money to TokenCard through a bank transfer.
TokenCard credits his account in the transfer equivalent of DGX.
7. Finally, he puts in his name to complete his account and profile picture.
He now has a Token Contract Wallet, can send and receive from others and make use of various services
like the token-to-token exchange. Once users get acquainted with the system they can apply for the
TokenCard itself. This launches a TokenCard application setup wizard:
1. Pay for TokenCard (if sufficient balance on Token Contract Wallet)
2. Next fill out a standard form with KYC/AML details that get forwarded to TokenCard. All
required KCY/AML can be done inside the app in the span of a few minutes.
3. TokenCard gets delivered to their home address.

TokenCard Transaction Walkthrough

TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP

TokenCard Transaction Walkthrough

With TokenCard, balances are stored in the user’s contract wallet, therefore we implement a unique
model where cards are effectively “empty” up until the moment they are used, known as a 0-balance
method.
The process goes as follows:
1. A user attempts a transaction.
2. A spend request API call from payments network comes in. Lists type, amount, CardID etc.
3. Database lookup on CardID to see what Token Contract Wallet address is associated with it.
4. Load Ethereum state and read Token Contract Wallet for settings: available balance, spending
modes, allowance etc.
5. Generate transaction specific payment profile. (100$: 80%ETH 20%DGX)
6. Evaluate an order book and calculate amount(s) to be used.
7. Perform sell
8. Initiate withdrawal from Token Contract Wallet
9. API call to load specific card with amount needed.
10. Confirm tx request.
11. User completes transaction and receives live push notification.

TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP

Server Specifications
Scale

The TokenCard system will support at launch 1,000 transactions per minute with maximum lag of 1
second at load, and “Four Nines” reliability worldwide.
8.11.2

Performance

The backend servers for TokenCard will be able to:
1. Accept a request from the debit network
2. Access a smart contract’s functions on the Ethereum Blockchain
3. Post a transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain
4. Respond to the debit network
All of these must be accomplished within 300ms in order to get a sub-one-second full latency from card
swipe to approval. As Ethereum scales, this will become easier to do without risk. In the beginning,
TokenCard will take some risk from double spending as it functions at the necessary speeds.
8.11.3

Backups and Failover

1. The TokenCard systems will be architected to achieve “four 9s” reliability: 4 minutes per month
or less of downtime.
2. Backups: TokenCard systems will be able to relaunch from a backup in under 1 minute.
3. Failover: The TokenCard systems will be able to failover successfully between regional datacenters.

8.12

Release schedule:

We expect TokenCard will take years to mature into our full vision. To get there, the team has
committed to a 120-day major release cadence.
Our first release will be an MVP in limited release.
8.12.1

Minimum Viable Product – 120 days

This MVP is aimed at users with some basic technical knowledge of Ethereum and gives access to the
core features: Token Contract Wallet, PoS/ATM payments debit card and payment support for tokens
like ETH, DGX, REP, 1ST, SNGLS and MKR. This phase will consist of a limited 500 card run and
will give priority access to early contributors.
We will release the MVP product and cards at a launch party exclusive to purchasers of TKN in the
Token Creation Event.

The 1.0 release of the TokenCard platform consists of delivering the technology detailed in this
document – primarily the Token App, instant in-app token exchange, advanced security options and
the initial asset management suite.

Finances

As we plan out the TokenCard future, we have put some time into projecting out business and TKN
values. These projections are necessarily flawed – we don’t know what will happen. Despite the highly
speculative nature of these projections, we are offering them to help those participating in the Token
Creation Event to understand different levers and possible outcomes for the project.
Since January 2017, Ethereum and the Token market have grown at a value-weighted average of about
300,000% annually (or 6.7x per three months). We do not believe this growth rate will continue over
the next two years. We have therefore taken a range of growth from 20% to 100% per six month period
as our range for projections.

9.1

Rough TKN Projections

Below are some rough projections of TKN performance under different conditions semi-annually over
four periods. We have made several assumptions described below and hypothetical context for the
scenarios is given.
We expect a good start to user growth with our platform, and expect to capture a substantial portion
of the Ethereum community and see success from launching in China. We also expect to see several
successful Ethereum platforms and tokens drive users to TokenCard.
We have based our average user spend on debit card reports that give an average spend of $9,291 per
year in the U.S.3 In general, there will be average higher user spend in earlier periods as adoption will
primarily consist of the underlying Ethereum community who hold substantial wealth. Average user
transaction spend declines as we expand to other markets.
Licensing fees are calculated simply as 1% of transaction volume and we have also taken into account
growth in users transacting in TKN.
9.1.1

Good

In a good scenario, we see quick adoption from the Ethereum community and expansion to other
markets happens successfully. We enter the Chinese market 12 months after launch, and some Ethereum
platforms and tokens see success outside of the community.

Better

In a better scenario, we have very good initial uptake from the underlying Ethereum community. We
expand to China successfully before the end of the first year with the help of marketing and customer
acquisition campaigns. We see success as a remittance solution, and certain Ethereum platforms and
tokens begin to see adoption by the general public, which also boosts our user-base.

Great

In the “great” scenario, marketing and customer acquisition strategies see very strong uptake initially.
We are able to expand to China quickly and secure several synergetic partnerships that help reach
other markets. Integration with successful innovative Ethereum platforms and tokens help expand
our user base even further. Customers spend less TKN because value is rising so quickly. Customer
acquisition strategies remain successful and adoption is fast.

Token Bonus

Contributors can contribute in certain tokens instead of ETH. Instructions and supported tokens will
appear on our website before the TKN Token Creation.
Tokens will have a per-token cap based on the trading volumes and value of the token.
Tokens that are partnered with TokenCard will receive a 2.5%-5% bonus in TKN; all details will appear
on our site before the Token Creation.

9.3

Additional TKN

Additional TKN will be created for the Capital Reserve, Monolith Studio, advisors and early investors
as follows.
9.3.1

Monolith Studio, and Advisors

• 20% of TKN created during the creation event will be created for Monolith Studio, locked in a
smart contract for 18 months. We wish to benefit only if the project is operationally successful.
• 5% of TKN created during the creation event will be created for and granted to advisors.
9.3.2

Capital Reserve

15% of the TKN supply will be credited to the reserve, but not issued. These TKN will be available
as an additional fundraising mechanism for the TokenCard project, but may never be issued, depending
on circumstances in the future. For more, read our section “Prudence”.
9.3.3

Example

During the Token Creation event, we imagine exactly 5 million TKN are created in response to
incoming payments.
After the Token Creation event ends, the following TKN are created:
• 1,666,667 TKN for Monolith Studio
• 416,666 TKN for advisors
• 1,250,000 TKN for the Reserve

FINANCES

In total, 7,083,333 TKN are ‘issued’ and 1,250,000 TKN are held in reserve.
If at some point, $7.08mm worth of tokens are held in the Token Asset Contract, and no TKN have
been burned. Each TKN would receive $1 worth of tokens if burned.

9.4

Funding Breakdown

Funds raised during the TKN Creation Event will be used solely for the development and benefit of
the Token platform. The level of funding received dictates the distribution of funds, however, our
TKN reserve structure allows us to reduce the variability in what can be achieved. Funding breakdown
in a $4.5mm funding scenario is discussed below.

9.5

Core Development – 30%

Core development will involve the building of the technology as described in this document. This
includes: the Token App, smart contract systems, payments network integration, server-side code and
exchange integration.

9.6

Operational – 25%

This covers the necessary costs incurred for a functional platform. This includes: sufficient individual
ERC20 token exchange balances, sufficient fiat counterpart balances covering 5 day transactional
volume, separate payments network costs, staffing, management and other related expenses.

9.7

Marketing – 40%

Marketing spend will be split into partnership spend and direct consumer marketing.
9.7.1

Partnerships and Ecosystem Integration – 15%

Ecosystem integration is an important component of our long-term plan for TokenCard. This long
term plan involves integrating projects and platforms with TokenCard, and exploring synergies that
return success for both parties. Part of this budget will also be allocated jointly with DigixGlobal,
through a partnership to access a broader user base.

9.8

Direct Sales and Marketing – 25%+

Sales and Marketing will drive this business, and the value of TKN. We intend to put as much money
and time into these as we possibly can in order to maximize the value of TokenCard and TKN and
dominate this post-bank era. Extra money contributed during Token Creation will be largely allocated
here as well.

Legal and Compliance – 5%

There are legal costs that go along with setting up an international financial services operation. Certain
services planned for the TokenCard platform, such as a ‘fiat to token’ exchange, may require proper
regulatory approval and licenses in some jurisdictions. Although these licenses are not typically difficult
to acquire, they incur costs: bonding, capital and operational.
